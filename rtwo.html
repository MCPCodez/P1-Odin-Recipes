        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>3 (8 ounce) packages sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>½ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>¾ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
            <li>⅔ cup rolled oats</li>
            <li>½ cup freshly shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, onion, garlic, salt, pepper, and oregano; cook and stir until mushrooms have released their juices and the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat. </li>
            <li>Transfer mushrooms to a cutting board and clean the skillet. </li>
            <li>Chop mushrooms into small chunks, then transfer to a large bowl. Mix in bread crumbs and oats, and season with salt and pepper as needed. Stir in Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, then eggs; let stand until bread crumbs have absorbed any excess liquid, about 15 minutes. Use moist hands to form mixture, 1/4 cup at a time, into patties. </li>
            <li>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry patties in the hot skillet until golden brown and cooked through, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes per side. </li>
        </ol>
